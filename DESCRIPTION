Description: The CCI (Computational Conditional Independence) package provides tools for performing computational tests 
             for conditional independence between variables in a dataset. The package supports machine learning regression and classification models
             including generlized linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Users can also integrate their custom models through a wrapper function interface. 
             CCI implements permutation in combination with Monte Carlo Cross-Validation in generating null distributions and test statistics, 
             allowing users to assess the significance of observed relationships under the null hypothesis of conditional independence.  @seealso \code{\link{citation}} for citing this package in publications.
